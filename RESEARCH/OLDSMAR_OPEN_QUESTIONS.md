# Oldsmar-Inspired Research  Open Questions and Missing Dependencies

## Purpose

This document enumerates **unresolved questions and missing artifacts** identified in publicly available reporting on the Oldsmar-inspired incident.

These questions are **not invitations to speculate**.

They are formal indicators of **where accountability could not be deterministically compiled** due to absent, ambiguous, or unavailable records at decision time.

If these questions cannot be answered with contemporaneous artifacts, then under GOS-FC doctrine:

> Accountability does not compile.

---

## Governing Principle

In GOS-FC, unresolved questions are not narrative gaps.
They are **compile-time failures**.

Later explanations, reinterpretations, or social consensus **do not resolve** these failures.

---

## Authority and Decision Questions

### Q1  Who had explicit authority over the affected control interface at the time of the event?
- What authority grants existed?
- What scope and constraints were defined?
- Were emergency authorities invoked, and if so, by whom?

**Missing artifact class:**  
- Time-bounded authority grants
- Emergency delegation records

---

### Q2  What specific decision, if any, authorized continued remote interaction capability?
- Was remote access explicitly approved?
- Was it temporary or permanent?
- Under what assumptions was it allowed?

**Missing artifact class:**  
- Decision records authorizing remote access
- Assumption declarations justifying its use

---

## Assumption Discipline Questions

### Q3  What assumptions were treated as true regarding safety controls and detection?
- Was it assumed human operators would always notice anomalies?
- Was monitoring assumed to be sufficient?
- Were rollback mechanisms assumed reliable?

**Missing artifact class:**  
- Explicit assumption declarations
- Assumption review or expiration triggers

---

### Q4  Were assumptions revisited after prior anomalies or alerts?
- If similar events occurred previously, were assumptions revalidated?
- Was drift acknowledged?

**Missing artifact class:**  
- Assumption revalidation records
- Drift acknowledgment artifacts

---

## Evidence and Observability Questions

### Q5  What contemporaneous evidence existed at the moment the event was detected?
- Screenshots?
- Logs?
- System state captures?
- Operator attestations recorded at the time?

**Missing artifact class:**  
- Time-stamped evidence bundles
- Immutable observability snapshots

---

### Q6  What evidence demonstrates that the reported parameter change occurred as described?
- Is the reported value change supported by primary artifacts?
- Are values derived from memory, logs, or later reconstruction?

**Missing artifact class:**  
- Primary configuration or state records
- Provenance metadata

---

## Custody and Integrity Questions

### Q7  How was evidence preserved immediately after the event?
- Who handled it?
- Where was it stored?
- Were custody transitions recorded?

**Missing artifact class:**  
- Chain-of-custody records
- Evidence handling procedures

---

### Q8  Were any records modified, corrected, or reinterpreted after the event?
- If so, were prior versions preserved?
- Was supersession explicit?

**Missing artifact class:**  
- Supersession records
- Versioned timelines

---

## Narrative Divergence Questions

### Q9  At what point did mutually incompatible explanations become acceptable?
- What artifact gap allowed reinterpretation?
- What evidence failed to constrain the narrative?

**Missing artifact class:**  
- Binding contemporaneous records that force convergence

---

### Q10  What specific artifact would have made later reinterpretation impossible?
- A single log?
- A decision record?
- An authority declaration?
- A sealed evidence bundle?

**Missing artifact class:**  
- Irreversibility-threshold markers

---

## Irreversibility Threshold

### Q11  When did the system cross the point where truth could no longer be preserved?
- At detection?
- At correction?
- At public disclosure?
- At evidence handling?

**Missing artifact class:**  
- Explicit irreversibility declarations
- Time-bounded truth-lock artifacts

---

## Meta-Governance Questions

### Q12  Which governance failures allowed epistemic collapse to occur?
- Missing decision capture?
- Informal authority?
- Undeclared assumptions?
- Weak custody discipline?

**Missing artifact class:**  
- Governance enforcement records

---

## Canonical Interpretation Rule

These questions are not resolved by:

- later reporting
- expert opinion
- institutional statements
- consensus narratives

They are resolved **only** by contemporaneous artifacts.

Absent those artifacts, accountability does not compile.

---

## Role in Scenario Construction

In later fictional scenarios, these open questions will be used to:

- define missing artifacts
- construct irreversibility moments
- demonstrate deterministic failure
- show how narrative laundering becomes possible

This document is an input to failure  not a path to explanation.
