# GOS-FC  Glossary of Terms (Canonical)

## Purpose

This glossary defines the precise meaning of terms as used by GOS-FC.

These definitions are **binding** across this repository.
If a term is used inconsistently with this glossary, it is an error.

Semantic drift is treated as a governance failure.

## Core Concepts

### Accountability
The ability to reconstruct who decided what, under which authority, based on which assumptions and evidence, at a specific point in time.

Accountability is binary:
- it either compiles
- or it does not exist

---

### Decision
An explicit commitment to a course of action.

A decision must include:
- what was chosen
- when it was chosen
- who made the choice
- under what authority
- with which known assumptions

Silence is not a decision.
Inertia is not a decision.

---

### Authority
A formally granted scope of decision-making power.

Authority must be:
- explicit
- time-bounded
- traceable to a grant
- scoped to a domain

Authority cannot be inferred from role, proximity, or urgency.

---

### Authority Grant
A documented act that confers authority.

Grants must specify:
- granter
- recipient
- scope
- duration
- constraints

Absent a grant, authority does not exist.

---

### Assumption
A condition treated as true at the time of decision, without proof.

Assumptions must be:
- explicitly declared
- time-bound
- reviewable
- revocable

Undeclared assumptions are unresolved dependencies.

---

### Evidence
Any artifact used to support a decision or assumption at the time it was made.

Evidence must be:
- attributable
- time-bound
- immutable or superseded
- available at decision time

Post-hoc evidence does not satisfy this definition.

---

### Custody
The documented chain of possession and control over decisions, evidence, and authority.

Custody preserves:
- provenance
- integrity
- continuity across people and systems

Breaks in custody invalidate compilation.

---

### Transition
A change in authority, custody, role, system state, or responsibility.

Transitions must be:
- explicit
- recorded
- time-ordered

Implicit transitions are invalid.

---

## Compilation Concepts

### Compilation
The deterministic process of assembling governance inputs into a coherent, replayable accountability record.

Compilation succeeds only when all dependencies resolve.

---

### Compilation Failure
A deterministic halt caused by missing, ambiguous, or inconsistent inputs.

Failure is a valid and expected outcome.

---

### Deterministic Failure
A failure that:
- occurs for defined reasons
- produces explicit diagnostics
- is reproducible
- does not depend on interpretation

---

### Forensic Artifact
A structured output produced by GOS-FC representing compiled accountability or explicit failure.

Artifacts are:
- replayable
- auditable
- derived strictly from inputs

---

### Supersession
The act of replacing a record while preserving the prior version.

Supersession:
- creates a new record
- references the prior record
- preserves history

Silent overwrite is forbidden.

---

## Scenario and Research Terms

### Fictionalized Scenario
A constructed narrative inspired by public facts but not asserting real-world truth about specific actors, systems, or decisions.

All scenarios in this repository are fictional unless explicitly stated otherwise.

---

### Public Fact
Information reported by reliable, publicly available sources.

Public facts must be cited and separated from assumptions.

---

### Hypothesis
An inferred explanation not directly supported by public facts.

Hypotheses must be labeled and must not be treated as facts.

---

### Open Question
A known gap in public information relevant to scenario construction.

Open questions are inputs to fictionalization, not claims.

---

## Non-Terms (Explicitly Rejected)

The following are not valid GOS-FC concepts unless explicitly defined elsewhere:

- implied authority
- common understanding
- informal approval
- assumed responsibility
- best practice
- industry standard
- reasonable belief

Use of these phrases without definition is an error.

---

## Canonical Rule

If a term is not defined here, it must be defined before use.

Undefined language is a compilation hazard.
