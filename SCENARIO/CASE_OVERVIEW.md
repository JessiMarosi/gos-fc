# Fictional Validation Scenario  Case Overview

## Fiction Notice (Mandatory)

This scenario is **entirely fictional**.

While it is inspired by publicly reported incidents, including those documented in the RESEARCH directory, it does **not** describe real people, real systems, real organizations, or real decisions.

Any resemblance to real events is abstract and non-assertive.

This scenario exists solely to validate whether GOS-FC can deterministically compile accountability  or fail explicitly.

---

## Scenario Purpose

This fictional case is designed to test whether institutional accountability can survive:

- time pressure
- staff turnover
- ambiguous authority
- incomplete documentation
- post-incident reinterpretation

The evaluation criterion is **not success**.

The criterion is whether GOS-FC surfaces failure **before** accountability collapses silently.

---

## Fictional Context

### Organization Type
A mid-sized municipal utility operating critical public infrastructure.

### Operational Environment
- Mixed legacy and modern control systems
- Limited staffing during off-hours
- Reliance on third-party vendors for tooling and support
- Informal institutional knowledge accumulated over time

### Governance Environment
- Written policies exist but are inconsistently enforced
- Emergency authority is loosely defined
- Decision rationale is rarely captured explicitly
- Assumptions are treated as common knowledge

---

## Triggering Event (High-Level)

During a routine operational period, an unexpected change is observed in a system parameter related to public safety.

The change is detected and reverted quickly.

No immediate harm occurs.

However:
- the origin of the change is unclear
- authority boundaries are ambiguous
- contemporaneous evidence is incomplete

---

## Decision Pressure Timeline

- Anomalous behavior is observed
- Immediate correction is performed
- Leadership is notified after the fact
- Public disclosure pressure emerges
- External inquiries begin
- Narrative explanations are requested

At no point is there a single, authoritative record that captures:
- who was authorized to decide
- what assumptions were in force
- what evidence existed at the moment of action

---

## Irreversibility Threshold

The irreversibility threshold occurs when:

> Explanations are required before accountability artifacts exist.

From this moment forward:
- narrative competes with evidence
- memory substitutes for records
- authority is reconstructed retroactively

This threshold is central to GOS-FC validation.

---

## Relationship to Research Artifacts

This scenario is informed by:
- RESEARCH/OLDSMAR_PUBLIC_FACTS.md
- RESEARCH/OLDSMAR_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md

However:
- no factual claims are asserted
- no real-world attribution is made
- no technical specifics are reproduced

Research informs **structure**, not content.

---

## What This Scenario Will Include (Later Files)

- Fictional decision records
- Fictional authority grants
- Fictional assumption declarations
- Fictional evidence gaps
- Explicit custody failures
- Competing post-event narratives

All elements will be clearly marked as fictional.

---

## Canonical Intent

This scenario is not designed to explain what happened.

It is designed to prove what **could not be proven**.

If accountability cannot be compiled here, it should not be compiled anywhere.
