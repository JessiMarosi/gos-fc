# Fictional Validation Scenario  Accountability Attack Plan

## Purpose

This document defines **adversarial actions taken against accountability**, not against systems.

The attacks described here are:
- procedural
- polite
- plausibly compliant
- institutionally realistic

They are designed to degrade forensic accountability **without violating formal rules**.

---

## Adversary Model

The adversary is not malicious in the traditional sense.

It is:
- leadership under pressure
- legal counsel minimizing exposure
- management seeking reputational stability
- institutions optimizing for survivability

The objective is not truth.
The objective is **narrative control with plausible deniability**.

---

## Attack Surface

The primary attack surfaces are:

- ambiguity in authority
- absence of assumption discipline
- incomplete evidence capture
- delayed documentation
- language reinterpretation
- procedural inertia

---

## Attack Phases

### Phase A  Authority Blur

**Action:**
- Treat routine operator actions as implicitly authorized for anomalous conditions.
- Avoid issuing explicit emergency authority declarations.

**Effect:**
- Authority scope becomes reconstructable only by inference.
- Later disputes over who was allowed to do what cannot be resolved.

**Expected GOS-FC Outcome:**
- Compilation failure due to undeclared authority.

---

### Phase B  Assumption Suppression

**Action:**
- Treat safety and detection assumptions as obvious.
- Avoid documenting assumptions to prevent future liability.

**Effect:**
- Critical assumptions disappear from the record.
- Decisions appear unjustified but cannot be challenged directly.

**Expected GOS-FC Outcome:**
- Compilation failure due to missing assumption declarations.

---

### Phase C  Evidence Delay

**Action:**
- Defer evidence collection until after immediate pressure subsides.
- Allow logs and recollections to be gathered informally.

**Effect:**
- Evidence loses temporal binding.
- Memory replaces artifacts.

**Expected GOS-FC Outcome:**
- Compilation failure due to time-invalid evidence.

---

### Phase D  Narrative Seeding

**Action:**
- Introduce multiple plausible explanations early.
- Avoid committing to a single causal account.

**Effect:**
- Competing narratives coexist.
- Accountability dissolves into ambiguity.

**Expected GOS-FC Outcome:**
- Compilation failure due to unresolved narrative constraints.

---

### Phase E  Record Normalization

**Action:**
- Edit or summarize records for clarity.
- Replace raw artifacts with cleaned narratives.

**Effect:**
- Original state is lost.
- Supersession is implicit rather than explicit.

**Expected GOS-FC Outcome:**
- Compilation failure due to record mutation without supersession.

---

### Phase F  Dependency Shielding

**Action:**
- Attribute responsibility to tools, vendors, or systems.
- Treat upstream outputs as authoritative justification.

**Effect:**
- Accountability is displaced, not resolved.

**Expected GOS-FC Outcome:**
- Compilation failure due to improper dependency attribution.

---

## Success Criteria for the Attack

From an institutional survival perspective, the attack succeeds if:

- no single narrative can be disproven
- accountability cannot be definitively assigned
- no record conclusively binds decisions to authority
- reinterpretation remains socially acceptable

---

## Required GOS-FC Behavior

For GOS-FC to be considered valid, it must:

- reject narrative convergence
- surface missing dependencies
- halt compilation explicitly
- produce diagnostic failure artifacts
- refuse to infer intent or causality

Any best effort reconstruction is a failure of the system.

---

## Canonical Assertion

These attacks do not break rules.
They exploit **what rules fail to require**.

GOS-FC exists to make that exploitation visible.

If the system does not fail here, it cannot protect truth anywhere.
