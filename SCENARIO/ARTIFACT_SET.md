# Fictional Validation Scenario  Artifact Set

## Purpose

This document enumerates **all governance-relevant artifacts** that exist or do not exist within the fictional scenario.

It is authoritative.

If an artifact is not listed here as existing, it must be treated as **absent**.
Absent artifacts are not inferred, reconstructed, or substituted.

---

## Artifact Classification

Artifacts are grouped into four classes:

1. Decision Records
2. Authority Records
3. Assumption Records
4. Evidence & Custody Records

Each artifact is explicitly marked as:
- EXISTS
- PARTIAL
- MISSING

---

## 1. Decision Records

### D-001  Immediate Correction Action
**Description:** Operator action reversing an unexpected system parameter change.  
**Status:** PARTIAL  
**Notes:** Action occurred; rationale was not recorded contemporaneously.

---

### D-002  Decision to Maintain Existing Remote Access Configuration
**Description:** Ongoing allowance of remote interaction capability prior to the event.  
**Status:** MISSING  
**Notes:** No explicit decision record authorizing or reaffirming this configuration exists.

---

### D-003  Decision to Delay Formal Documentation
**Description:** Informal choice to prioritize operations over documentation during the event window.  
**Status:** MISSING  
**Notes:** This decision is inferred by absence of records but is not documented.

---

## 2. Authority Records

### A-001  Operator Authority Scope
**Description:** Authority granted to on-duty operators for routine control actions.  
**Status:** PARTIAL  
**Notes:** Role-based authority exists, but scope boundaries during anomalous conditions are undefined.

---

### A-002  Emergency Authority Declaration
**Description:** Formal invocation of emergency authority during the event.  
**Status:** MISSING  
**Notes:** No emergency declaration or expanded authority grant exists.

---

### A-003  Vendor or Third-Party Authority
**Description:** Authority of external vendors to access or modify systems.  
**Status:** PARTIAL  
**Notes:** Contractual relationships exist, but operational authority at event time is unclear.

---

## 3. Assumption Records

### AS-001  Human Detection Assumption
**Description:** Assumption that operators would notice anomalous behavior in real time.  
**Status:** MISSING  
**Notes:** Treated as true, but never declared or reviewed.

---

### AS-002  Monitoring Sufficiency Assumption
**Description:** Assumption that existing monitoring would surface unsafe conditions.  
**Status:** MISSING  
**Notes:** No explicit assumption declaration or validation exists.

---

### AS-003  Reversibility Assumption
**Description:** Assumption that unsafe changes could always be reversed safely.  
**Status:** MISSING  
**Notes:** No documented analysis or constraint exists.

---

## 4. Evidence & Custody Records

### E-001  Contemporaneous System State Capture
**Description:** Snapshot of system state at moment of detection.  
**Status:** MISSING  
**Notes:** No immutable capture exists.

---

### E-002  Operator Observation Record
**Description:** Time-stamped record of what the operator observed.  
**Status:** PARTIAL  
**Notes:** Recollections exist, but were recorded after the fact.

---

### E-003  Log Preservation Bundle
**Description:** Sealed bundle of logs and telemetry preserved immediately after the event.  
**Status:** PARTIAL  
**Notes:** Logs exist, but custody, completeness, and timing are unclear.

---

### E-004  Chain of Custody Record
**Description:** Documented custody transitions for evidence artifacts.  
**Status:** MISSING  
**Notes:** No formal chain-of-custody record exists.

---

## Irreversibility Marker

### I-001  Narrative Commitment Moment
**Description:** Point at which public or institutional explanations were required before artifacts were secured.  
**Status:** EXISTS  
**Notes:** This marks the irreversibility threshold for accountability.

---

## Canonical Interpretation Rule

- PARTIAL artifacts do not satisfy compilation requirements.
- MISSING artifacts are unresolved dependencies.
- No artifact may be retroactively created to satisfy a dependency.

This artifact set defines the **maximum possible accountability** available in the scenario.
