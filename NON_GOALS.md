# GOS-FC  Explicit Non-Goals (Canonical)

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines what GOS-FC **explicitly refuses to become**, even if such features appear useful, popular, marketable, or adjacent.

These non-goals exist to:

- prevent scope creep
- prevent institutional misuse
- prevent narrative laundering
- preserve deterministic forensic integrity

If a proposed feature aligns with any item below, it is **out of scope and forbidden**.

---

## GOS-FC Is Not an Outcome Judge

GOS-FC does not determine whether a decision was:

- correct
- optimal
- ethical
- legal
- justified
- reasonable
- negligent
- reckless
- compliant or non-compliant

GOS-FC compiles **what can be proven**, not what should have happened.

Judgment is explicitly out of scope.

---

## GOS-FC Is Not an Attribution System

GOS-FC does not:

- assign blame
- infer intent
- identify attackers
- identify responsible individuals
- determine culpability
- rank responsibility
- distinguish malice from error

Any output that implies fault, intent, or responsibility exceeds GOS-FCs mandate.

---

## GOS-FC Is Not a Detection or Monitoring System

GOS-FC does not:

- detect incidents
- monitor systems
- observe live activity
- ingest telemetry streams
- analyze logs for threats
- provide alerts
- operate in real time

GOS-FC is strictly **post-hoc and record-based**.

---

## GOS-FC Is Not an Enforcement Mechanism

GOS-FC does not:

- block actions
- approve actions
- deny access
- enforce policy
- trigger remediation
- mandate controls
- automate consequences

GOS-FC has no authority and exercises no power.

---

## GOS-FC Is Not a Compliance Tool

GOS-FC does not:

- certify compliance
- score maturity
- generate attestations
- replace audits
- satisfy regulatory checklists
- claim adherence to standards

Compliance may exist independently of accountability.
GOS-FC does not equate the two.

---

## GOS-FC Is Not a Governance Platform

GOS-FC does not:

- define policy
- create governance structures
- manage workflows
- approve governance models
- replace boards, councils, or leadership

It evaluates whether governance artifacts **can be reconstructed**, not whether governance was good.

---

## GOS-FC Is Not a Risk or Prediction Engine

GOS-FC does not:

- model future risk
- assign probabilities
- estimate likelihood
- forecast outcomes
- simulate impact
- optimize decisions

All probabilistic reasoning is out of scope.

---

## GOS-FC Is Not an AI System

GOS-FC does not:

- learn from data
- infer missing information
- hallucinate explanations
- smooth gaps
- guess intent
- fill in records

All missing inputs remain missing.
Inference is treated as failure.

---

## GOS-FC Is Not a Narrative Generator

GOS-FC does not:

- reconcile conflicting stories
- choose a preferred narrative
- harmonize accounts
- produce persuasive explanations
- generate public-facing summaries

Any narrative output is strictly derived from compiled inputs or failure diagnostics.

---

## GOS-FC Is Not a Data Lake or Archive

GOS-FC does not:

- centralize raw data
- store operational telemetry
- act as a system of record
- retain sensitive datasets

It operates on **declared artifacts**, not bulk data ingestion.

---

## GOS-FC Does Not Replace Its Dependencies

GOS-FC does not replace:

- DADS (decision capture)
- ChainLogic-DCCS (custody and authority integrity)
- Cairn (assumption tracking)
- Axiom Forge (formal obligation discipline)
- Veridion (integrity state validation)
- DeepSee-Live (context preservation)
- StrataVault (data boundary enforcement)

GOS-FC consumes their outputs.
It does not perform their functions.

---

## Anti-Expansion Rule

If a proposed feature:

- makes GOS-FC more convenient
- makes outputs more palatable
- reduces visible failure
- hides ambiguity
- resolves uncertainty automatically
- increases adoption at the cost of rigor

That feature must be rejected.

---

## Canonical Statement

GOS-FC exists to determine whether accountability **can be compiled**.

It does not fix accountability.
It does not replace accountability.
It does not excuse the absence of accountability.

Anything beyond that is a non-goal.
