# CANONICAL RUN  GOS-FC

This repository contains a deterministic forensic compiler.

The primary evidence of its behavior is **the compiled output**, not the documentation.

If you read only one artifact, read the failure report below.

## Canonical Output

**Deterministic Failure Bundle (Fictional Validation Run)**  
 outputs/EXAMPLE_FAILURE_BUNDLE.md

This bundle is the result of attempting to compile institutional accountability
from incomplete authority, missing assumptions, and time-shifted evidence.

The compiler **fails intentionally and deterministically**.

---

## What This Demonstrates

**Claim:**  
Given incomplete authority and missing decision-time assumptions,  
GOS-FC will deterministically fail and enumerate the missing accountability dependencies.

The linked failure bundle is the proof of that claim.

---

## How to Read This Repository

1. Read the failure bundle.
2. Review the compiler failure semantics:
   - compiler/FAILURE_CATALOG.md
   - compiler/PIPELINE.md
3. Read the doctrine and boundaries **only if** you want to understand
   why the failure is correct and non-negotiable.

This repository does not ask you to imagine how the system works.

It shows you what it did.
